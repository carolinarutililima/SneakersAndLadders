Hello, 

To used this algorith you need to download some python packges as random, numpy, and gym. 

There are 3 versions, 0, 1 and 2. Each one has the value interarion and q learning algorithm. To run the
algorithm you just need to choose how many spots, and change de size of V, Q and Eligibility matrix, for example, 
100 spots it's necessary to change to 101, 200 to 201, ... And on the environment chance the grid size, 
if you want to use 100 spots, put 1 on the size on the environmet.
